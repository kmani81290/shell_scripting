Managing Users and Groups

There are four main user administration files −

    /etc/passwd − Keeps the user account and password information. This file holds the majority of information about accounts on the Unix system.

    /etc/shadow − Holds the encrypted password of the corresponding account. Not all the systems support this file.

    /etc/group − This file contains the group information for each account.

    /etc/gshadow − This file contains secure group account information.

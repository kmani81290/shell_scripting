Scenario:
 >GIS has requested that every file in the chartertest folder that is of type .DWG be collected and placed into a folder called “DWG”, you will need to create this folder, it can be outside of the chartertest folder.
   >This process needs to be repeatable so it can run as a cronjob.
    >We do not want any subdirectories created inside the DWG folder, just a collection of all dwg files found in “chartertest”.
    >There will be duplicate files in the dataset, if you run into a duplicate or duplicate
